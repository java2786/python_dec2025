## 1. Basics – Printing, Variables, Data Types  
- Print your name, college name, and city using three variables.  
- Store marks of three subjects and print the total.  
- Declare a Celsius temperature variable and print: “Today's temperature is 36°C”  
- Create variables `name`, `age`, and `city`. Print a self-introduction.  
- Given `price = 299.99` and `quantity = 3`, calculate the total bill.

## 2. Input, Arithmetic Operators, Type Conversion  
- Take name and age as input and print them in a sentence.  
- Take two numbers and print sum, difference, product, and quotient.  
- Input radius of a circle and calculate area and perimeter.  
- Input two numbers and swap them using a third variable.  
- Take marks in 5 subjects and print total, average, and percentage.

## 3. Conditional Statements (if, else-if, nested if)  
- Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.  
- Check if someone is eligible for voting (age >= 18).  
- Find the largest of two and three numbers.  
- Grading system:  
    - `90+ → Grade A`  
    - `75–89 → Grade B`  
    - `50–74 → Grade C`  
    - `<50 → Fail`  
- Check if a year is a leap year.

## 4. Logical Operators, Nested If, Switch/Case  
- Check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.  
- Input a character and check if it's a vowel or consonant.  
- Input day number (1 to 7) and print the corresponding day using switch-case.  
- Student eligibility: Attendance percentage >= 75%.  
- Password checker: enter password and confirm password.
